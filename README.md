Abstract
--------

This _physics simulation_ is about simplified _rocket science_. _Rocket Science_ comes along without any sophisticated graphical human machine interface so far. The concept is __turn based__. On each turn the user enters a numerical value for the __fuel burn rate__ of the excursion module in a valid range.

Objectives
----------

__Main objective__ is to land the excursion module safely. Flight control is by instruments only rather than visually landing the _Lunar Excursion Module (LEM)_. _Instrument Landing System (ILS)_ shows a defect. You are supposed to perform the landing maneuvers manually. An __additional objective__ is to optimise the fuel consumption.
